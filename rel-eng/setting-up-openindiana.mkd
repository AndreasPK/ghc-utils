# Setting up OpenIndiana

Here we are using the `hipster` release.

1. Install the distribution.

2. `sshd` is running in the installation by default.
   Login, find the IP address, and `ssh` in.

3. Install 
```
sudo pkg install \
    library/gmp \
    git developer/gcc-6 autoconf automake \
    python-34
```
Here is where I stopped.
