# Scripts useful in GHC release engineering

Here are a variety of tools I've developed for working with various virtualised
environments when building and testing [GHC](http://haskell.org/ghc).

In addition, one can find notes. For instance, see `setting-up-centos-vms.mkd`
for a rough description of how the CentOS binary distributions are built.
